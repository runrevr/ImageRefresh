    suggestedPrompt: "Transform the uploaded photo by replacing only the hair region with an iconic mullet hairstyle.\n1. Use the image's hair mask to isolate the hairâ€”do not touch the face, body, clothing, or background.\n2. Match the original hair color, texture, and density exactly.\n3. Randomly choose one of these top-hair styles for each run:\n   - curly, teased volume\n   - short, textured spikes\n   - feathered, classic '80s layers\n   - sleek, modern taper\n4. In every variation, the back must be noticeably longer than the front (\"business in front, party in back\").\n5. Preserve **all** facial attributes exactly as in the original, including:\n   - Skin tone and smoothness (no new wrinkles, age spots, or blemishes)\n   - Facial proportions and bone structure\n   - Eye color, eye shape, lips, and expression\n   - Age appearance (do **not** make the subject look older or younger)\n6. Seamlessly blend shadows, highlights, and lighting so the new hair looks like part of the original photograph.\n\n**Negative constraints** (do **not**):\n- Alter any aspect of the face, skin texture, or age cues.\n- Introduce wrinkles, sagging, or any aging artifacts.\n- Change posture, clothing, background, or cropping.",
