/**
 * This file is for verifying the checkout flow functionality
 *
 * The checkout flow works in two parts:
 * 1. Create a payment intent on the server (saves metadata like userId and credits)
 * 2. After payment completion:
 *    - Webhook updates the database with credits (primary method)
 *    - If webhook fails, the account page detects the completion and updates credits
 */

// Verify the checkout flow works as follows:
// 1. On successful payment, Stripe redirects to /account?payment_status=completed
// 2. Account page detects this parameter and calls /api/purchase-credits 
// 3. This ensures credits are added even if webhook fails
// 4. Database gets updated with the purchased credits
