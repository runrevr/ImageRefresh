# Implementation Plan: Unified Data Structure for Categories, Styles, and Prompts

## Phase 1: Data Structure Creation (Completed)
- Created centralized data structure for categories, styles, and prompts
- Defined TypeScript interfaces in `data.types.ts`
- Implemented comprehensive `data.json` with hierarchical organization
- Added utility functions in `data.utils.ts` for data access and filtering

## Phase 2: Grid View Implementation (Current)

### Overview
Create a responsive 3x3 grid view for displaying categories and styles using the new data structure.

### Goals
- Display categories in a visually appealing grid layout
- Allow selection of categories to view associated styles
- Maintain consistent styling with the current application design
- Implement smooth transitions between views
- Support responsive layout for various screen sizes

### Implementation Steps

1. **Update Ideas Page Layout**
   - Modify `ideas-page.tsx` to use the new data structure
   - Create a 3x3 grid view component for categories
   - Implement responsive grid for various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

2. **Category Grid Component**
   - Display category cards with icons, names, and descriptions
   - Add hover effects and selection state visual cues
   - Include category count badges if applicable

3. **Style Grid Component**
   - Create a grid view for displaying styles within a selected category
   - Include style cards with before/after image previews
   - Implement hover interactions for showing transformations

4. **Navigation and State Management**
   - Track selected category state
   - Add breadcrumb navigation for category/style selection
   - Implement "back to categories" functionality

5. **Style Selection Integration**
   - Connect style selection to the existing transformation flow
   - Ensure selected styles are saved to localStorage as before
   - Redirect to upload/transform page after selection

6. **UI Enhancements**
   - Add loading states for asynchronous operations
   - Implement smooth transitions between category and style views
   - Ensure consistent styling with the application's design language

### User Flow
1. User visits "Ideas" page
2. Category grid (3x3) is displayed with visual icons and names
3. User selects a category
4. Grid transitions to show styles within the selected category
5. User hovers over style cards to see before/after preview
6. User selects a style and is redirected to the upload/transform page
7. Selected style is applied to the next transformation

### Technical Approach
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layout
- Implement useState hooks for managing selected category
- Apply consistent styling with existing shadcn components
- Use Lucide icons for category representation
- Leverage the data utility functions for filtering and selection
