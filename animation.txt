Design a small pixel-style adventurer character (boy or girl) with a playful, confident, or determined expression, sitting or standing on a brown brick platform, holding a glowing orb. For a boy, the character should have a more rugged and adventurous look, with a bold, structured design — like a simple but strong chest emblem and energetic pose. For a girl, the character should have a playful, whimsical design — a floral-inspired chest emblem or softer, rounded features with a joyful expression and fluid motion in the pose. The character should wear a bright green shirt and blue pants. The scene features a bright solid blue sky, pixelated white clouds outlined in black, rolling green hills, rounded pixelated trees, and colorful pixel flowers growing from floating brick blocks. Add a large green warp pipe with a red-and-green plant emerging from it, small turtle-like pixel creatures walking nearby, and floating question mark blocks above. The overall style should feel cheerful, energetic, bright, and nostalgic, capturing the playful, lively atmosphere of classic side-scrolling adventure games. The character should have a playful attitude, but do not copy real-world facial features or likenesses.",
