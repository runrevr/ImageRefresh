We are still getting this error from the OpenAI API when sending images for transformation:

java
Copy
Edit
400 Invalid file 'image': unsupported mimetype ('application/octet-stream'). Supported file formats are 'image/jpeg', 'image/png', and 'image/webp'.
We need to ENSURE that when we upload images (especially PNG), the server does NOT send them to OpenAI with the MIME type 'application/octet-stream', but instead with their correct type ('image/png', 'image/jpeg', or 'image/webp').

Please do the following:

Check the upload handling code. Make sure that when files are received from the client, their extension is preserved, and the file is not being renamed or altered in a way that loses the extension or content-type.

Check the code that sends the image to OpenAI (where FormData is built):

Use the mime-types npm package to detect the file's MIME type based on its extension.

When calling formData.append('image', fs.createReadStream(imagePath), { filename: ..., contentType: ... }), make sure that contentType is set to the real MIME type (not left blank, not defaulted to application/octet-stream).

Add a log right before sending to OpenAI that prints out the file path and the MIME type being used.

Example code to use for verifying the MIME type:

js
Copy
Edit
const mime = require('mime-types');
const filePath = imagePath; // path to the image file
const detectedMime = mime.lookup(filePath);
console.log("[TEST] About to send file:", filePath);
console.log("[TEST] Detected mime-type:", detectedMime);
formData.append('image', fs.createReadStream(filePath), {
  filename: path.basename(filePath),
  contentType: detectedMime,
});
Test it by uploading a PNG. The log should show [TEST] Detected mime-type: image/png and the error should be gone. If not, check every step where the image is handled to see where the type gets lost.

Do not send the image if detectedMime is not one of the supported types. Log a clear error if this is the case.

Please reply back with the log output and confirm that the correct MIME type is being sent to OpenAI!
