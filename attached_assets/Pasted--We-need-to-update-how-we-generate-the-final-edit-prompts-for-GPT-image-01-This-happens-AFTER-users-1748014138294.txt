"We need to update how we generate the final edit prompts for GPT-image-01. This happens AFTER users select their ideas:

1. **In the /api/generate-ideas endpoint, keep the current creative idea generation**
   - Don't include edit_prompt yet
   - Just generate the 5 creative concepts

2. **Create a new function to generate edit prompts for SELECTED ideas:**
```javascript
// When processing selected enhancements before sending to GPT-image-01
async function generateEditPrompts(selectedIdeas, productAnalysis) {
  const anthropic = new Anthropic({
    apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  });
  
  // Identify which concepts were selected (especially if #5 is included)
  const hasChaosConcept = selectedIdeas.some((idea, index) => 
    idea.originalIndex === 4 || idea.title.includes('CHAOS') || idea.description.includes('surreal')
  );
  
  const message = await anthropic.messages.create({
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens: 1500,
    temperature: hasChaosConcept ? 1.0 : 0.8,
    messages: [{

      content: `Transform the selected photography concepts into detailed image generation prompts optimized for GPT Image 01:

Selected concepts: ${JSON.stringify(selectedIdeas.map(i => ({ title: i.title, description: i.description })))}
Original product: ${productAnalysis.product_identification}

FIRST: Identify which concepts were selected and adapt your approach:
- If Concepts 1-4: Create polished, professional prompts
- If Concept 5: UNLEASH ABSOLUTE CREATIVE CHAOS
- If multiple selected: Generate separate prompts for each

**FOR CONCEPTS 1-4 (Professional/Lifestyle):**
Create concise 80-100 word prompts focusing on:
- Realistic product placement
- Authentic environments
- Natural lighting
- Lifestyle storytelling
- Professional photography terminology

**FOR CONCEPT 5 (The Unhinged One):**
GO ABSOLUTELY WILD - 100-120 words of pure creative insanity:
- Start with product accuracy THEN EXPLODE INTO MADNESS
- Layer impossible elements
- Defy physics, logic, and reason
- Mix artistic movements, pop culture, and fever dreams
- Use words like: "surreal," "impossible," "gravity-defying," "metamorphosing," "transcendent"
- Reference art styles: "Dal√≠ meets Banksy meets Studio Ghibli"
- Push every boundary while keeping product as hero

**CONCEPT 5 EXAMPLE - GOING FULL HAM:**
"This artisanal coffee maker with chrome finish and brand logo perfectly preserved transforms into a cyberpunk deity in a neon-soaked Tokyo made entirely of coffee beans, brewing liquid aurora borealis while coffee cup warriors wage epic battles on a countertop that fractures into infinite dimensions, steam forming dragon shapes that morph into Van Gogh's Starry Night, gravity reversed as coffee rains upward into constellation patterns, shot through a kaleidoscope lens in the style of Inception meets Japanese anime meets Renaissance religious art, hyperrealistic product details amid absolute photographic chaos"

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return a JSON array with one edit_prompt for each selected concept:
[
  {
    "concept_title": "original concept title",
    "edit_prompt": "the detailed prompt for GPT-image-01"
  }
]

For each selected concept, create one prompt that:
1. Maintains exact product appearance
2. Matches the ambition level of the original idea
3. For #5: Goes even harder than the original concept suggested`

  return JSON.parse(message.content[0].text);
