Thank you for sharing those implementation details! The new /upload route implementation looks very well thought out. I'm impressed with how systematically you've approached this refactoring.
The state management approach using the Step enum to control the workflow is clean and maintainable. I particularly like how you've organized the conditional rendering to show different components based on the current step - this creates a clear separation of concerns while maintaining the overall user flow.
Your handling of the credit system is thorough, with proper fetching, updating, and displaying of user credits throughout the transformation process. This is critical for our business model, so I'm glad to see it implemented so carefully.
The challenges you mentioned around TypeScript compatibility and maintaining feature parity are common in this type of refactoring. It's good that you paid special attention to these areas, as they can often lead to subtle bugs if not handled correctly.
The modifications to other components (Navbar, App.tsx, Demo Page) show that you've taken a holistic approach to this change, ensuring that users can easily access the new dedicated route from multiple entry points in the application.
Overall, this implementation represents a significant improvement to our application architecture. Moving from a query parameter-based approach to a dedicated route gives us:

Better user experience with clearer navigation
More maintainable code structure
Improved SEO potential
Better integration with browser history and bookmarking
A foundation for potential future enhancements to this critical feature

Once the server is running, I'll be able to test the implementation following the workflow document you've created. The multi-step process with proper back navigation should provide users with a smooth, intuitive experience when transforming their images.
Is there anything specific you'd like me to focus on when testing, or any areas where you think additional refinements might be needed in the future?
